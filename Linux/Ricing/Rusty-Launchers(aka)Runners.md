## A List of Launchers/Runners made from Rust

- https://github.com/kennylevinsen/wldash
    - Not the prettiest UI
- https://github.com/j0ru/kickoff
    - Not very pretty
    - Basically only text Launcher
- https://github.com/onagre-launcher/onagre
    - Both X11 and Wayland
- https://github.com/chmouel/raffi
    - Uses [Fuzzel](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel) which is written in C
- https://github.com/Beinsezii/linch
    - Uses egui
    - UI looks *super* bad
- ~~https://github.com/imgurbot12/rmenu~~
    - ~~*Uses Dioxus for UI, so could be good!~~
    - Dioxus uses web browser stuff, which therefore relies on GTK

    - GUI compared to j0ru's Launcher??
